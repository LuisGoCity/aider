# Implementation Plan for Redirect Status Code Change

## Task Outline
Update the redirect status code in the middleware from 307 (Temporary Redirect) to 301 (Permanent Redirect) for Great Cities websites (parispass.com, romeandvaticanpass.com, newyorkpass.com) to improve SEO strength and rankings.

## Steps
1. Modify the `middleware.ts` file to update the `NextResponse.redirect()` call to include the status code parameter of 301 instead of the default 307.

## Warning
- Changing from temporary to permanent redirects may cause browsers to cache the redirects more aggressively. This could make it harder to change the redirect behavior in the future if needed.
- Ensure that the redirects are indeed intended to be permanent, as search engines and browsers will remember these redirects for a longer time.
- After implementation, verify the redirect behavior using browser developer tools or a tool like curl to confirm the status code is correctly set to 301.
