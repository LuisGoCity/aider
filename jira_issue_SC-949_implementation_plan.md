# Implementation Plan for Updating Git PR Command

## Task Outline
Update the Git implementation to use the command "git push origin -u <branchname>" when raising pull requests to avoid errors during the first push and ensure all affected tests are updated.

## Steps

### Step 1: Update the `push_commited_changes` method in `aider/repo.py`
**Files to modify:** `aider/repo.py`

- Modify the method signature to accept a branch name parameter
- Update the command construction to use `git push origin -u <branchname>` format
- Implement proper error handling with try/except blocks
- Add informative error messages for common failure scenarios
- Return a tuple containing success/failure status and any error message
- Document the updated method with appropriate docstring

### Step 2: Add a helper method `get_current_branch_name` in `aider/repo.py`
**Files to modify:** `aider/repo.py`

- Create a new method to safely retrieve the current branch name
- Handle potential errors when accessing branch information
- Add special handling for detached HEAD states
- Return the branch name as a string or None if unavailable
- Include appropriate error logging for troubleshooting
- Document the method with a clear docstring explaining its purpose and return values

### Step 3: Modify the `raise_pr` method in `aider/repo.py`
**Files to modify:** `aider/repo.py`

- Get the current branch name using the new helper method
- Call the updated `push_commited_changes` method with the branch name
- Check the return status from `push_commited_changes`
- Only proceed with PR creation if the push was successful
- Add appropriate error messaging to the user when push fails
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Update the method's docstring to reflect the changes

### Step 4: Add a new test case `test_push_commited_changes` to `tests/basic/test_repo.py`
**Files to modify:** `tests/basic/test_repo.py`

- Create a new test method to verify the updated `push_commited_changes` functionality
- Mock subprocess.run to simulate successful and failed push scenarios
- Verify the command is constructed correctly with the branch name and -u flag
- Test the return values in different scenarios (success/failure)
- Validate error handling for common failure cases
- Ensure the test is isolated and doesn't perform actual git operations

### Step 5: Update `test_raise_pr` in `tests/basic/test_repo.py`
**Files to modify:** `tests/basic/test_repo.py`

- Modify the existing test to account for the updated `raise_pr` method
- Add assertions to verify the correct push command is used before PR creation
- Mock the subprocess calls to simulate both push and PR creation
- Check that the branch name is correctly passed to the push command
- Verify the -u flag is included in the push command
- Ensure the test validates the entire workflow from push to PR creation

### Step 6: Update `test_raise_pr_error_handling` in `tests/basic/test_repo.py`
**Files to modify:** `tests/basic/test_repo.py`

- Enhance the test to cover scenarios where the push fails
- Verify that PR creation is not attempted when push fails
- Check that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user
- Test the behavior when the branch name cannot be determined
- Ensure the command sequence is correct (push first, then PR)
- Validate that the method handles exceptions gracefully

## Warning

- The implementation must handle cases where the git command fails and provide meaningful error messages
- Care must be taken to preserve backward compatibility with existing code that might call these methods
- The current implementation uses subprocess directly, which means error handling is critical
- The tests must mock subprocess calls correctly to avoid actual git operations during testing
- Edge cases to consider include:
  - Repositories with no remote named "origin"
  - Detached HEAD states where there is no current branch
  - Permission issues when pushing to remote repositories
  - Network failures during push operations
- The changes should be minimal and focused on fixing the specific issue with the push command
- Test coverage should be comprehensive to ensure the changes don't introduce regressions
