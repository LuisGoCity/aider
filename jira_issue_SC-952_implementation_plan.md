I'll implement the feature according to the JIRA ticket requirements. Let me review the test file to understand how to properly implement and test the new functionality.

# Implementation Plan for Adding `--with-code-cleanup` Argument to `cmd_solve_jira`

## Task Outline
Add an optional `--with-code-cleanup` argument to the `cmd_solve_jira` function in the `Commands` class to allow users to trigger code cleanup as part of the automated JIRA ticket solving process. The cleanup should use intensity level "low" when enabled.

## Steps

1. **Update the docstring of `cmd_solve_jira` method in `aider/commands.py`**
   - Modify the existing docstring to include information about the new `--with-code-cleanup` option
   - File: `aider/commands.py`

2. **Extend argument parsing logic in `cmd_solve_jira` method in `aider/commands.py`**
   - Add logic to recognize and extract the new `--with-code-cleanup` flag from command arguments
   - Preserve the existing `--with-pr` flag functionality
   - File: `aider/commands.py`

3. **Add conditional logic to trigger code cleanup in `cmd_solve_jira` method in `aider/commands.py`**
   - Implement code to call the `cmd_clean_code` method with "low" intensity when the flag is present
   - Position this logic after JIRA ticket implementation but before PR creation
   - File: `aider/commands.py`

4. **Create a test for the `--with-code-cleanup` flag in `tests/basic/test_commands.py`**
   - Add a test case that verifies the `cmd_solve_jira` method correctly triggers code cleanup when the flag is provided
   - File: `tests/basic/test_commands.py`

5. **Create a test for combined flags in `tests/basic/test_commands.py`**
   - Add a test case that verifies both `--with-pr` and `--with-code-cleanup` flags work correctly together
   - Ensure code cleanup is performed before PR creation
   - File: `tests/basic/test_commands.py`

## Warning
- The code cleanup must be performed before any PR creation to include the cleaned code in the PR.
- Ensure the existing `--with-pr` flag functionality continues to work correctly both alone and in combination with the new flag.
- The JIRA ticket specifies using "intensity 1" for code cleanup, which corresponds to "low" intensity in the `cmd_clean_code` method.
- Be careful to maintain backward compatibility with existing usage patterns of the `cmd_solve_jira` method.
