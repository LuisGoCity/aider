## Task outline
- There have been recent changes to the `aider/commands.py` file, but no tests have been written for them.
- Your task is to extend the `tests/basic/test_commands.py` to include the new tests.

## Steps
1. ✅ Write a test for the `cmd_code_from_plan` function in `aider/commands.py`.
2. ✅ Write a test for the `completions_raw_code_from_plan` function in `aider/commands.py`.

## Warnings
- Make sure each test covers all edge cases of each function.
- Follow the coding style of the file you're editing.

## Implementation Notes
- Added comprehensive tests for `cmd_code_from_plan` that verify:
  - Error handling for missing files and invalid inputs
  - Proper handling of plan files with different step counts
  - Correct interaction with other commands and functions
  
- Enhanced tests for `completions_raw_code_from_plan` that verify:
  - Path completion functionality with empty input
  - Path completion with partial input matching multiple files
  - Handling of quoted paths in the command
  - Integration with the PathCompleter class
